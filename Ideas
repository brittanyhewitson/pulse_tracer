Ideas for Capstone projects

Note: when adding ideas, please indicate what you think are the different aspects that would need to go into it,
        such as circuitry, coding, system, etc.
        
        
1) Problem to solve: older population = more falling and possible brain injury
    Solution: fall detector that will alert chosen care provider/ medical staff, but will also wait for a few
                seconds to see if subject will get back up. Attach EEG to keep train of brain activity
                in case fall was caused by abnormal brain activity, or if fall caused abnormal brain activity
    Systems:
        Coding - write code to alert care providers
        Circuitry - build EEG - could either buy or make accelerometer?
        Others - have not thought that far yet, but will need some sort of casing for easy wearing
